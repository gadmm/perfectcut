perfectcut.sty --- Nested delimiters that consistently grow regardless
of the contents.

This package defines the command \perfectcut#1#2 which displays a
bracket <#1||#2>. Various delimiters are similarly defined. The effect
of these commands is to let the delimiters grow according to the number
of nested \perfectcommands (regardless of the size of the contents).

The package is originally intended for solving a notational issue
regarding the representation of abstract-machine-like calculi in proof
theory and computer science. For general use, the package also defines
commands for defining custom delimiters that behave in the same way.

This package also offers a sound reimplementation of \big, \bigg, etc.


Release notes:

  2.1      : * the spacing inside cases can be contolled with \cutcasebarskip
             * corrected a bug where vertical bars would shrink horizontally
             * corrected the spacing of middle delimiters
  2.0 11/14: * The package now offers general-purpose commands for
               defining arbitrary nested delimiters that consistently
               grow regardless of the contents (\perfectunary and
               \perfectbinary)   
             * Added the behaviours CurrentHeight and
               CurrentHeightPlusOne alongside the existing behaviour
               IncreaseHeight. 
             * Added the stock commands \perfectcase, \perfectparens,
               and \perfectbrackets intended for use in the context
               of abstract-machine-like calculi.
 1.9b 05/14: added the option fixxits to fix vertical alignment with the
             XITS math font.
  1.9 02/14: added \perfectcut,\perfectbra,\perfectket; fixed bug with graphicx
             not being included; publication on CTAN.
  1.8 01/14: added documentation (no new feature).
  1.7 11/13: added \cutangleouterskip.
  1.6 10/13: new commands \cutbraprimitive and \cutketprimitive.
  1.5 09/13: possible to disable mathstyle (option nomathstyle, see
             the warning below).
  1.4 08/13: possible to choose between \vert\vert and \Vert (option realVert)
             (\cutinterbarskip is used only with the former).
  1.3 08/13: fixes the alignment of angles with the math axis.
  1.2 06/13: first public release.
